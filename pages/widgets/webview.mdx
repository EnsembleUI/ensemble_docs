| allowedLaunchSchemes | array of strings | Only available on iOS and Android native apps. Will not have any affect on the web. Optionally specify array of url schemes such as 'tel:', 'mailto:', 'geo:' that when tapped should launch the apps corresponding to the scheme in the system the app is running in.. See below for more details for this property. URL schemes such as http and https are included by default and cannot be overwritten. |

**allowedLaunchSchemes**

Array of strings.

- tel: opens the phone dialer
- mailto: opens the email client
- geo: opens the map application
- sms: opens the messaging application

When `allowedLaunchSchemes` is not present, by default the following schemes are permitted.
'tel:',
'sms:',
'mailto:',
'geo:'

You can override the defaults by specifying the `allowedLaunchSchemes`.

For example - if you are displaying messages inside your webview and want the users to be able to slack someone, you will specify the allowed url schemes as follows -

```yaml
- WebView:
    url: https://messages.mycompany.com
    allowedLaunchSchemes:
      - "tel:"
      - "sms:"
      - "mailto:"
      - "slack:"

  #note that if you explicitly specify `allowedLaunchSchemes` you must specify the defaults as well if you want them to be allowed otherwise they will be overwritten
```

In order to add additional schemes to the default schemes, specify the default schemes and the additional schemes as an array value of allowedLaunchSchemes. URL schemes such as http and https are included by default and cannot be overwritten.

## JavaScript Channels

Use `javascriptChannels` to receive messages sent from the page loaded in the WebView. Each channel has a `name` and an `onMessageReceived` handler. Messages arrive as strings in `event.data.message`.

Example:

```yaml
- WebView:
    id: testWebView
    url: https://10.0.2.2:5501/test_webview_channels.html
    styles:
      height: 300
    javascriptChannels:
      - name: AppBridge
        onMessageReceived:
          executeCode:
            body: |
              console.log("Received from AppBridge: " + event.data.message);
              myMessage.text = event.data.message;

      - name: PaymentChannel
        onMessageReceived:
          executeCode:
            body: |
              console.log("Received from PaymentChannel: " + event.data.message);
              var data = JSON.parse(event.data.message);
              if (data.action === "process_payment") {
                paymentStatus.text = 'Processing payment...';
              }
```

From the page, call `YourChannelName.postMessage(payload)` where `payload` is a string (use `JSON.stringify` for structured data).

Sending messages from the page:

```html
<script>
  // Send a simple string
  window.AppBridge.postMessage('Hello from WebView!');

  // Send structured data as JSON string
  window.PaymentChannel.postMessage(
    JSON.stringify({ action: 'process_payment', amount: 29.99, currency: 'USD' })
  );
</script>
```

## Header Override Rules

The `headerOverrideRules` property allows you to specify different headers for different URLs based on patterns. This is useful when you need to apply different headers for different domains or API endpoints. Each rule consists of:

| Property      | Type    | Description                                                                          |
| :------------ | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| urlPattern    | string  | The URL pattern to match against                                                     |
| matchType     | string  | Type of match: 'CONTAINS', 'EXACT', 'REGEX'. Defaults to 'CONTAINS' if not specified |
| headers       | object  | Headers to apply when pattern matches                                                |
| mergeExisting | boolean | If true, merges with existing headers. If false, replaces them                       |

Example:

```yaml
headerOverrideRules:
  - urlPattern: "api.example.com"
    matchType: CONTAINS
    headers:
      SECRET: abc123
    mergeExisting: true
```

## Events

| Event               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| onPageFinished      | Invoked when a page has finished loading.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| onProgress          | Invoked when a page is loading to report the progress.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| onNavigationRequest | Invoked when a decision for a navigation request is pending. When a navigation is initiated by the WebView (e.g when a user clicks a link) this delegate is called and has to decide how to proceed with the navigation. |
| onWebResourceError  | Invoked when a resource loading error occurred.                                                                                                                                                                          |

| width                        | integer           | By default the width will match its parent's available width, but you can set an explicit width here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| height                       | integer           | If no height is specified, the web view will stretch its height to fit its content, in which case a scrollable parent is required to scroll the content. You may override this behavior by explicitly set the web view's height here, or uses 'expanded' to fill the available height.                                            |
