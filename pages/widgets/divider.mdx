# Divider

The Divider Widget is a simple, horizontal or vertical line that separates content visually within your application's layout. It is primarily used to create a clear distinction between different sections or components, improving the overall readability and organization of the interface. Common use cases include separating items in lists, forms, or between groups of content in both web and mobile applications.

Below is a preview of the Divider in action:
