# Host EDL on your own server

Ensemble automatically serve your application code (EDL). It also allows you to take the EDL from ensemble studio and serve it our your own server.

<Steps>
### Download the app.

<Callout type="info">
You must have owner or editor permission 
</Callout>

Go to your app in ensemble studio and click on three dot icon button. 
Here click Download App button. 

![download app](/images/host-edl/download-app.png)

In few time a zip will be downloaded in your local computer. 
This zip includes everything that your client app needs.

Unzip the files and you'll see some structure like following. 
<FileTree>
    <FileTree.File name=".env" />
    <FileTree.File name="Home.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="appConfig.json" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="i18n" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="en.yaml" />
      <FileTree.File name="hi.yaml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="resources.ensemble" />
    <FileTree.File name="theme.ensemble" />
</FileTree>

<Callout type="info">
Do not change any filename, extension or location of file.
</Callout>


### Serve the files
 
<Callout type="info">
The server code present here is just for demo purpose.  
</Callout>


```python
from flask import Flask, abort, Response
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

BASE_DIR = '<here-put-the-path-of-downloaded-app>'

@app.route('<path:filepath>')

@app.route('/<app>/<path:filepath>')
def serve_file(app, filepath):
    safe_app = os.path.normpath(app)
    safe_filepath = os.path.normpath(filepath)

    full_path = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, safe_app, safe_filepath)

    if not full_path.startswith(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, safe_app)):
        abort(403, "Access denied")

    if os.path.isfile(full_path):
        with open(full_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
        return Response(content, mimetype='text/plain; charset=utf-8')
    else:
        abort(404, description="Resource not found")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)

```
fyi: This server code is used to serve static files of your application and you can run this by simply `python filename.py`

`BASE_DIR` is where all the downloaded from from download app button are available.
Here just make sure, the file serving route of your server can take filepath as parameter. 
`filepath` can be `Home.yaml` or `i18n/en.yaml`.


### Configure the client app
<Callout type="info">
Make sure your file serving server is live.  
</Callout>

Go to your `ensemble-config.yaml` under your `ensemble` directory in your client application.

```yaml
definitions:
  from: remote # here change local or ensemble to remote
  
  remote:
    path: https://your-domain.com
    appId: <name-of-your-app-folder> 
    appHome: <name-of-your-home-page>
    i18nPath: https://your-domain.com/appId/i18n
```

</Steps>
