# Configuration of Firebase Project with Ensemble App

Application's performance significantly increases with ⁤Integrating Firebase with our Ensemble project. ⁤⁤Firebase offers some services, such as real-time databases, authentication, analytics, and cloud messaging, which can help streamline backend development, 
improve user engagement, and provide deep insights into user behavior. ⁤⁤Using Firebase with Ensemble allows us to focus more on our application's core features and user experience, while Firebase handles the backend.
⁤Now, let's dive into the configuration steps:


## Prerequisites
Before we start configuration, ensure that we have the following in place:
1. Ensemble project to integrate with Firebase.
2. Head over to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project or use an existing one.

## 1. Registering our App with Firebase

Firebase supports integration with various app platforms. Here's a breakdown for each platform:

![All Apps](/images/firebase/addApp.png)
#### Android

- Click the Android icon(looks like a little robot) to start the setup.
- Type the unique "Android Package Name". Make sure it matches our app's exact name, and remember, it's case-sensitive!

<Callout type="info">
  To learn more about how to get our Android package name for ensemble application, click [here](/deploy/4-android-device.md).
</Callout>

- Click "Register app" to complete this step.
- Finally, download a file called "google-services.json". This file holds all the secret handshake information Firebase needs to talk to our app.


#### iOS

- Click the Apple icon to start the setup.
- Enter our app's unique ID (called a "bundle ID"). Make sure it matches our app's exact name, and remember, it's case-sensitive!

<Callout type="info">
  To learn more about how and where we can find our "Bundle ID" for ensemble application, click [here](/deploy/3-ios-appstore.md).
</Callout>

- Click "Register app" to complete this step.
- Download a file called "GoogleService-Info.plist". This file contains the secret details Firebase needs to work with your app.

#### Web

- Click the Web icon(looks like a globe) to start the setup.
- Give our web app a nickname(this is just for us to see in the Firebase console).
- Click "Register app" to complete this step.
- Firebase will provide on-screen instructions where we will find a portion with the name `firebaseConfig` in code given. Copy that portion and save it in a file with the rest configuration files.

## 2. Configure Ensemble app
Now that we've registered our app with Firebase and downloaded the configuration files, 
it's time to establish the connection within our Ensemble project.
#### Make a Configuration File

The first step involves creating a configuration file that stores Firebase project details specific to our chosen platform (iOS, Android, or Web). This file
acts as a translator between our app and Firebase, providing the necessary information for them to communicate effectively. The file will look like:

```yaml
{
  "web": {
    # Copy and paste all the values of firebaseCongig variable that we copy from web app and paste it here.
  },
  "android": {
    "apiKey": # In google-services.json, take value of client.api_key.current_key,
    "appId": # In google-services.json, take value of client.client_info.mobilesdk_app_id,
    "messagingSenderId": # In google-services.json, take value of project_info.project_number,
    "projectId": # In google-services.json, take value of project_info.project_id,
    "storageBucket": # In google-services.json, take value of project_info.storage_bucket
  },
  "ios": {
    "apiKey": # In GoogleService-Info.plist, take the value of API_KEY,
    "appId": # In GoogleService-Info.plist, take the value of GOOGLE_APP_ID,
    "messagingSenderId": # In GoogleService-Info.plist, take the value of GCM_SENDER_ID,
    "projectId": # In GoogleService-Info.plist, take the value of PROJECT_ID,
    "storageBucket": # In GoogleService-Info.plist, take the value of STORAGE_BUCKET,
    "iosBundleId": # In GoogleService-Info.plist, take the value of BUNDLE_ID
  }
}
```
After we have replaced the placeholder hashtags (#) in our configuration file, it will look like this:

#### Update Environmental Variables

Within our Ensemble application, navigate to the settings section and look for the option to manage environmental variables. Here, we'll create the following variables:
- `api_providers`: Set the value of this variable to `firestore`. This tells our app to use Firebase Firestore as a data provider.
- `firestore_config`: This is where you'll paste the complete configuration file we created earlier, including the replaced values from our downloaded configuration files.
- `firebase_config`: Similar to `firestore_config`, this variable is required when using Firebase Functions or Firebase App Check. Use the same configuration file format and values as above.

<Callout type="info">
  The `firebase_config` environment variable follows the same structure and values as `firestore_config`. It's specifically needed when implementing Firebase Functions or Firebase App Check in your Ensemble application.
</Callout>

By following these steps, we'll successfully establish a connection between your Ensemble app and Firebase.
