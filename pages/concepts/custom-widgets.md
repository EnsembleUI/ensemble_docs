# Custom Widgets
In addition to Ensemble-provided widgets and containers, you can create custom widgets to extend the functionality of your app. Custom widgets can be used to encapsulate complex logic, create reusable components, or integrate with third-party libraries.

Custom Widgets can be created and used within a Screen or globally across multiple screens.
