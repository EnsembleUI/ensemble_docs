# Calling Cloud Firestore APIs

[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Ensemble platform provides a deep integration with the Firestore DB and allows you to call operations on your data in Firestore effortlessly. 

Unlike traditional relational databases, Firestore offers a document-based structure well-suited for storing and managing various data types within oour app. Firestore is a great choice for Ensemble applications because it provides simplified data modeling, Offline Persistence, Real-time Updates, and API Convenience to interact with data.⁤

Now, let's dive into performing basic operations on our Firestore database:

- To get hands-on experience with firestore operations, check the live example on [Ensemble Studio](https://studio.ensembleui.com/app/e24402cb-75e2-404c-866c-29e6c3dd7992/screen/W7b1n4a1LVoQgLyAie4F)

## Firestore Data types

### Timestamp
Following methods are available for Firestore's Timestamp type. 

#### Timestamp.now()
Static method. Returns a Timestamp representing the current time.

Example
```js
var currentTimestamp = Timestamp.now();
console.log(currentTimestamp);
```
#### Timestamp.fromDate(date)
Static method. Creates a Timestamp from a JavaScript [Date](https://docs.ensembleui.com/javascript-reference/Date) object.
Example
```js
var specificDate = new Date('2024-08-05T12:34:56Z');
var specificTimestamp = Timestamp.fromDate(specificDate);
console.log(specificTimestamp);
```

#### Timestamp.fromMillis(milliseconds)
Static method. Creates a Timestamp from a given number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

Example
```js
var milliseconds = 1691237696123; // Milliseconds since the Unix epoch
var timestampFromMillis = Timestamp.fromMillis(milliseconds);
console.log(timestampFromMillis);
```

#### new Timestamp(seconds, nanoseconds)
Constructor. Creates a Timestamp object from a given number of seconds since the Unix epoch and additional nanoseconds.

Example
```js
var seconds = 1691237696;
var nanoseconds = 123456789;
var customTimestamp = new Timestamp(seconds, nanoseconds);
console.log(customTimestamp);
```
#### toDate()
Converts a Timestamp to the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
Example
```js
var milliseconds = customTimestamp.toMillis();
console.log(milliseconds);
```
#### valueOf()
Returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch, similar to toMillis(). It’s used when Timestamp is compared to other values in arithmetic operations.

Example
```js
var value = customTimestamp.valueOf();
console.log(value);
```

Following properties are also available on each `Timestamp` object

#### seconds
The number of seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

Example
```js
var timestamp = new Timestamp(10,0);
console.log(timestamp.seconds); //prints 10
```
#### nanoseconds
The number of nanoseconds of UTC time since Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

Example
```js
var timestamp = new Timestamp(10,0);
console.log(timestamp.nanoseconds); //prints 0
```

## 1. Creating a Firestore Collection

To store data in Firestore, we need to create a collection. A collection in Firestore is a container for documents, 
which are individual pieces of data. Each document contains a set of key-value pairs. Follow the given steps to create a collection:
- Go to the Firebase Console.
- Select our project.
- Navigate to Firestore Database in the side menu.
- Click on Start collection.
- Enter a collection ID (e.g., sports).
- We can add our first document by entering a document ID or let Firestore auto-generate one for us.
- Add fields and values to our document.
- Click Save.

<Callout type="info">
  By default, firestore rules do not allow anyone to access our database. To get started with it, update the rules by changing it to `allow read, write;` which allow everyone to access our database and then update the rules according to our requirements.
</Callout>

## 2. Types of Firestore Operations
Firestore offers various operations to interact with our data. Here's a breakdown of some core operations along with demo API calls for our Ensemble app

### Get:
This operation retrieves data from our Firestore collections. We can either retrieve entire collections or use queries to filter and sort our data.
1. **Example (Get all users)**:
```yaml
getUsers:
  type: firestore
  path: users
  listenForChanges: true
```
**Explanation**:
- `type: firestore`: Specifies that the operation is for Firestore and it is not a RestAPI.
- `path`: The path to the collection or document from where we wanna retrieve the data.
- `listenForChanges`: The operation will listen for real-time updates if set to true and triggers the UI to update.
> Default vale for `operation` is set to `add` if not mentioned.
> Note: When listen for changes is set to true, the first response from the API will be {"message": "Subscribed to API", documents: []}. Note this if you are doing any response handling involvng checking if documents is empty.
2. **Example (Get user using multiple filters)**:
```yaml
getSpecificUsers:
  inputs:
    - userId
  type: firestore
  path: example/users
  query:
    where:
      - field: _documentId
        operator: ==
        value: ${userId}
    orderBy:
      - age
    limit: 10
```

**Explanation**:
- `inputs`: We can also use dynamic variables in the path or a query.
- `path`: Path can be any based on our collections and documents we are trying to access.
- `query`: Filters the data based on the conditions such as [where](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/queries). [orderBy, Limit](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/order-limit-data).

### Add:
The `add` operation creates a new document in a collection with a specified or auto-generated ID.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
createProject:
  inputs:
    - userId
    - proName
    - proDes
    - proFiles
  type: firestore
  path: users/${userId}/Projects
  operation: add
  data:
    proName: ${proName}
    description: ${proDes}
    createdAt: ${(new Date()).toISOString()}
```
**Explanation**:
- `operation: add`: Indicates that a new document will be created.
- `data`: The fields and values for the new document.

### Set:
The `set` operation can create a new document if it does not exist but if the document already exists, `set` will overwrite 
the entire document with the data provided, unless we use the `merge` option.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
setProject:
  inputs:
    - userId
    - projectID
    - proName
    - proDes
    - proFiles
  type: firestore
  path: users/${userId}/Projects/${projectID}
  operation: set
  data:
    proName: ${proName}
    description: ${proDes}
    setAt: ${(new Date()).toISOString()}
```

### Update:
The `update` operation only updates the fields specified in the provided data. If the document does not exist, `update` 
will fail with an error.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
inputs:
    - userId
    - projectID
  type: firestore
  path: users/${userId}/Projects/${projectID}
  operation: update
  data:
    # Below files will be stored as Array of objects.
    files: [{ name: "index.js" , lines: 78 },{ name: "LMS.js" , lines: 245 }] 
    lastUpdated: ${(new Date()).toISOString()}
```

### Delete:
The `delete` operation removes a document from a collection.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
deleteProject:
  inputs:
    - userId
    - projectID
  type: firestore
  path: users/${userId}/Projects/${projectID}
  operation: delete
```

### Collection Group:
The `isCollectionGroup` feature is used to retrieve specific collections from any collection. For example, if we have 100 documents in the `users` collection and each document has a sub-collection named `projects`, the `isCollectionGroup` feature helps in getting all `projects` directly rather than iterating through each document.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
getAllProjects:
  type: firestore
  path: Projects
  isCollectionGroup: true
```

## 3. Response of Firestore Operations
When performing Firestore operations, we may need to manipulate the responses to fit our application's needs. Below are some common ways demonstrating how to use YAML for API calls, handle states, and display data in our app.
#### 1. Firstly, we will make an API call as follow:
```yaml
invokeAPI:
  name: getProjects
  inputs:
    userId: ${userID}
```
> We can also use `onResponse` & `onError` on firebase API calls and can perform operations on response.

#### 2. Using response in `Column`:
To display data based on the API call's state (loading, success, error), you can use the following structure:
```yaml
Column:
  children:
    - Column:
        styles:
          visible: '${getProjects.isLoading ? true : false}'
        children:
          - Progress:
              display: circular
    - Column:
        styles:
          visible: '${getProjects.isSuccess ? true : false}'
        item-template:
          data: ${getProjects.body.documents}
          name: project
          template:
            projectDisplay: # that is an custom widget.
              inputs:
                name: ${project.proName}
                des: ${project.description}
    - Column:
        styles:
          visible: '${getProjects.isError ? true : false}'
        children:
          - Text:
              text: "An error has occurred"
```
- Explanation:
  - The first child `Column` is visible only when the API call is loading `(visible: '${getProjects.isLoading ? true : false}')`. It shows a circular progress indicator.
  - The second child `Column` is visible only when the API call is successful `(visible: '${getProjects.isSuccess ? true : false}')`. It iterates over the documents in the response body using item-template.
  - The third child `Column` is visible only when there is an error `(visible: '${getProjects.isError ? true : false}')`. It shows an error message.

#### 3. Using response in `Dropdown`:
To display data in a dropdown, we can use the following YAML structure:
```yaml
Dropdown:
  id: selectProject
  label: Select Project
  itemTemplate:
    data: ${getProjects.body.documents}
    name: project
    value: ${project._documentId}
    template:
      Text:
        text: ${"Name:" + " " + project.proName}
```

By using these operations, we can efficiently manage our data in Firestore with an Ensemble project. Firestore's 
real-time capabilities and simple API calls make it a powerful tool for any application.
