# Interact with APIs

The primary mechanism for an Ensemble app to interact with the backend is through APIs.

The basic flow is:

- [First, define the APIs you want to call](define-api)
- [Invoke API calls](call-api) on events such as onLoad or onTap
- [Access the API response](access-api-response)
- [Handle errors](api-on-error)

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  During develoment, you can [mock APIs within Ensemble](use-mock-api-response).
</Callout>


Following capabilities are also available in Ensemble:


- [Bind APIs to a template to render a series of widgets](api-item-templates)
- [SSL Configuration](api-ssl-configuration)
- [Chaining API calls](chaining-apis)
- [Websocket](websocket)
- [GraphQL](graphql)
