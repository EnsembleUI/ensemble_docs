# Operations in Firestore Firebase

Firebase Firestore is a flexible and scalable NoSQL database service that easily integrates with our Ensemble application. 
Unlike traditional relational databases, Firestore offers a document-based structure well-suited for storing and managing various data types within oour app. Firestore is a great choice for Ensemble applications 
because it provides simplified data modeling, Offline Persistence, Real-time Updates, and API Convenience to interact with data.‚Å§
Now, let's dive into performing basic operations on our Firestore database:

  Operations on Firestore won't work unless we have configured our Ensemble application with Firebase. Learn how to configure it [here](pages/firebase/configuration.mdx).

## 1. Creating a Firestore Collection

To store data in Firestore, we need to create a collection. A collection in Firestore is a container for documents, 
which are individual pieces of data. Each document contains a set of key-value pairs. Follow the given steps to create a collection:
- Go to the Firebase Console.
- Select our project.
- Navigate to Firestore Database in the side menu.
- Click on Start collection.
- Enter a collection ID (e.g., sports).
- We can add our first document by entering a document ID or let Firestore auto-generate one for us.
- Add fields and values to our document.
- Click Save.

  By default, firestore rules do not allow anyone to access our database. To get started with it, update the rules by changing it to `allow read, write;` which allow everyone to access our database and then update the rules according to our requirements.

## 2. Types of Firestore Operations
Firestore offers various operations to interact with our data. Here's a breakdown of some core operations along with demo API calls for our Ensemble app

### Get:
This operation retrieves data from our Firestore collections. We can either retrieve entire collections or use queries to filter and sort our data.
1. **Example (Get all users)**:
```yaml
getUsers:
    type: firestore
    path: users
    listenForChanges: true
```
**Explanation**:
- `type: firestore`: Specifies that the operation is for Firestore and it is not a RestAPI.
- `path`: The path to the collection or document from where we wanna retrieve the data.
- `listenForChanges`: The operation will listen for real-time updates if set to true and triggers the UI to update.
> Default vale for `operation` is set to `add` if not mentioned.
2. **Example (Get user using multiple filters)**:
```yaml
getSpecificUsers:
    inputs:
      - userId
    type: firestore
    path: example/users
    query:
      where:
        - field: _documentId
          operator: ==
          value: ${userId}
      orderBy:
        - age
      limit: 10
    pagination:
      startAfter:
        - age: 25
      endBefore: 56
      limitToLast: null
```
**Explanation**:
- `inputs`: We can also use dynamic variables in the path or a query.
- `path`: Path can be any based on our collections and documents we are trying to access.
- `query`: Filters the data based on the conditions such as [where](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/queries). [orderBy, Limit](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/order-limit-data).
- `pagination`: It returns a specific data group from a collection or document. It can have the following values:
  - `startAt`: It defines the starting point for retrieved data based on a specified column. In the above case, we will get users starting from 25 years older and above.
  - `startAfter`: It also defines the starting point but excludes the specified value.
  - `endAt`: It defines the ending point of the data being retrieved.
  - `endBefore`: It also defines the ending point but to the value just before the mentioned one. As mentioned, it will retrieve data to 55.
  - `limitToLast`: Specify if needed, overrides `limit` if both are provided.

### Add:
The `add` operation creates a new document in a collection with a specified or auto-generated ID.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
createUser:
  type: firestore
  path: example/users
  operation: add
  data:
    name: { First: Harry, Last: Potter }
    age: 45
    gender: Male
```
**Explanation**:
- `operation: add`: Indicates that a new document will be created.
- `data`: The fields and values for the new document.

### Set:
The `set` operation can create a new document if it does not exist but if the document already exists, `set` will overwrite 
the entire document with the data provided, unless we use the `merge` option.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
setUser:
  inputs:
    - name
    - age
    - gender
  type: firestore
  path: example/users
  operation: set
  data:
    name: ${name}
    age: ${age}
    gender: ${gender}
```

#### Update:
The `update` operation only updates the fields specified in the provided data. If the document does not exist, `update` 
will fail with an error.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
updateUser:
  inputs:
    - age
  type: firestore
  path: example/users
  operation: update
  data:
    age: ${age}
```

#### Delete:
The `delete` operation removes a document from a collection.
1. **Example**:
```yaml
deleteUser:
  inputs:
    - userID
  type: firestore
  path: example/users/${userID}
  operation: delete
```
By using these operations, we can efficiently manage our data in Firestore with an Ensemble project. Firestore's 
real-time capabilities and simple API calls make it a powerful tool for any application.
